### Hello there!
My name is Rohan Mistry (@rmluck). I am currently a first-year student (sophomore in standing) at UC Irvine, studying Computer Science at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. I have had an interest in computer science for a long time and am very excited to be able to pursue that passion at college now.

## Skills
I have familiarized myself with Python over the first year in college and have some prior knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C++.

## High School
Prior to entering college, I was a student at Ruben S. Ayala High, part of their Academy of Engineering and Computer Sciences for four years. I learned some basic coding skills through AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science Applications as well as learning various engineering concepts in courses such as Introduction to Engineering Design, Civil Engineering and Architecture, and Engineering Design and Development. Along with a few friends, I helped co-found the Ayala VEX Robotics Club and Ayala Information & Computer Science Club. For the former, I was treasurer for three years, managing the club's budget, scheduling fundraisers and purchasing necessary robotics parts and equipment. I was also the primary programmer (C++) for my individual robotics team for four years.
