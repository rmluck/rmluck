## High School
Prior to entering college, I was a student at Ruben S. Ayala High, part of their Academy of Engineering and Computer Sciences for four years. Co-founded the Ayala VEX Robotics Club and Ayala Information & Computer Science Club. For the former, I was treasurer for three years, managing the club's budget, scheduling fundraisers and purchasing necessary robotics parts and equipment. I was also the primary programmer (C++) for my individual robotics team for four years.
