### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Rohan Mistry** (@rmluck). I am currently a third-year student from Chino Hills, CA enrolled at [UC Irvine](https://www.uci.edu), studying Computer Science at the [Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.ics.uci.edu). I have had an interest in computer science for a long time and am very excited to be able to pursue that passion at college now!

## Skills
I have familiarized myself with Python over the first year in college and have some prior knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C++.

## Projects
You can find my I&C SCI 32 projects [here](https://github.com/stars/rmluck/lists/ics-32).

## High School
Prior to entering college, I was a student at Ruben S. Ayala High, part of their Academy of Engineering and Computer Sciences for four years. Co-founded the Ayala VEX Robotics Club and Ayala Information & Computer Science Club. For the former, I was treasurer for three years, managing the club's budget, scheduling fundraisers and purchasing necessary robotics parts and equipment. I was also the primary programmer (C++) for my individual robotics team for four years.
